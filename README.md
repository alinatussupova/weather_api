<h1>Weather Data API</h1>


I've built my own REST API, to access to the weather data for the last 200 years. 


I analyze and clean data, using pandas. Afterward, based on this collected data, I created API that calls specific station and/or date, and shows the rellevant data.


<h3>Tech stack I used throughout this project:</h3>

* Python3
* Flask
* Pandas
* HTML
